## Inspiration
I had an amazing experience during the workshop, My point of view about programming totally changed. I decided to simulate a human mind but as I have not much experience, I decided to come up with restricted and basic scenarios such as one 911 medical emergency.

## What it does
This Application generates a set of answers according to caller input and extracted guidelines from the 911 call center. https://www.eugene-or.gov/2892/9-1-1-Call-Scripts

## How we built it
This Application built white help of Prolog and s(CasP) system. this app simulates the 911 call operator mind, with respect to the provided guideline on the following link https://www.eugene-or.gov/2892/9-1-1-Call-Scripts Call operator must gather useful information from the caller in order to provide suitable and effective emergency service. 

## Challenges we ran into
Challenge 1: changing my mind to follow the new method of programming was so difficult. I used to think that we have a function, variable, parameter and it executes from bottom to top, we have if, else, and so on. But this approach is totally different I had to use Prolog and sCasp to simulate human-style reasoning and define the relationship of predicates, rules and use the Negations as Failure,  to draw conclusions from the absence of information.
Challenge 2: I decided 1000 times to just turn off the computer and go to sleep as I was not able to even execute one line of my thought through ProLog and sCasp. as I was thinking differently about this approach.
Challenge 3: As I work FullTime I did not have much time to deeply learn both ProLog and sCasp. I watched the workshop two times and several Youtube tutorials, and plenty of time to develop my idea.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Finally, I was able to generate a set of possible answers from given facts and guidelines. I know that this application has a lot to work on but I learned a small amount of knowledge about how to use Negation as failure instead of the classic way of common sense reasoning. And It is executable :D.

## What we learned
I learned to do not give up easily.
I learned this approach has huge potential to become the future of common sense reasoning.
I learned how ProLog works and execute the code under the hood.
I learned What is sCasp and what is the purpose of this system.
I cannot say I fully know how this system works, but at least I learned to work around and convert some guidelines and facts into code that is executable by the machine.

## What's next for Emergency-Bot
I believe this application has a long way to go, and it is hard to specifically describe the future of this app, but this method of programming has enough potential to pass current burdens.
